        h1 A Talk With No Name

        <!-- Welcome to a talk that is so fresh and original, it doesn't even have a name yet. You are so lucky. Just like that horse in that song. You know, the horse with no name. Lucky horse. No name. No one can tell it what to do. It was a free spirit. No one was saying, "Hey, go faster, Mr. Ed, I've got a sprint planning meeting I'm late for!" No, instead, they're like, "I'd tell this horse to go faster but I don't know how to address this horse. I do not know this horse's name." That's like this talk. You cannot control it. So just let go! Let it take you wherever it wants to take you on its waves of bliss. Are you ready? Good. Here we go. -->

        h2 Let's talk about streams&hellip;
        
        <!-- If you ever listen to Node core contributors talk about streams... -->

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='terrifying')

        <!-- ...it is TERRIFYING. It's like, "Yeah, only one person actually understands the streams code base. And actually, they don't understand it either. No one understands it." And then someone comes along and says, "Gosh, it's so complex, shouldn't we work on refactoring it to make it more understandable?" And eight other people say "DO. NOT. TOUCH. THE. STREAMS. CODE. Did you not hear us say that no one understands how it works?!" When you hear that sort of stuff, it makes approaching the Node.js code base intimidating.-->

      section

        <!-- So then some well-meaning person decides, "I'd like to contribute to Node. But I'm not going to do something like even try to READ the streams code. I know! I'll run a JavaScript lint checking tool on the code base and submit fixes!" -->

      section

        <!-- So this is for all my Lint Peeps out there. Lint Peeps: I love you. But you gotta stop doing this. Here's the thing: Node already has a linter. We're not going to change the thousands of instances of `==` throughout the code to `===` just because Douglass Crockford things everyone should. And there are actually good reasons not to make those kinds of wholesale changes on a sprawling code base. -->
